# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Performance Metrics Calculation in Script
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the evaluation script to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each of the four specified tags (Button, Input, Radio, Dropdown) based on the matching results.
# Details:
Precision = TP / (TP + FP). Recall = TP / (TP + FN). F1-score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall). Handle division-by-zero cases.

# Test Strategy:
Using sample files with known counts, manually calculate the expected metrics and compare them against the script's output to ensure correctness.
