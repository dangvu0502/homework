# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project and Web Application Boilerplate
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository. Set up a basic frontend web application structure using a modern framework (e.g., React, Vue) and a backend stub for future API integration.
# Details:
Includes installing dependencies, configuring build tools (like Vite or Webpack), and creating the initial file structure for components, services, and styles.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the development server runs and a basic 'Hello World' page is displayed in the browser. The repository should be created on a version control system.
