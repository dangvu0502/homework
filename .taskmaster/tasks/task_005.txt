# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement 'Save' Functionality for Ground Truth
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a 'Save' button that exports the list of bounding boxes and their assigned tags into a structured JSON file, which the user can download.
# Details:
The JSON format should be well-defined, containing the image name, and a list of objects, each with coordinates (e.g., x, y, width, height) and a label.

# Test Strategy:
Label an image with several boxes, click 'Save', and inspect the downloaded JSON file to ensure it matches the expected format and contains the correct data.
