# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Evaluation Script: Data Parsing and Box Matching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial structure of the command-line evaluation script. It should parse a directory of ground truth JSON files and a directory of prediction JSON files and match predicted boxes to ground truth boxes.
# Details:
Matching will be based on Intersection over Union (IoU) with a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5). A predicted box is a match if its IoU with a ground truth box is above the threshold and the labels are the same.

# Test Strategy:
Create sample ground truth and prediction JSON files. Run the script and manually verify that it correctly identifies true positives, false positives, and false negatives.
