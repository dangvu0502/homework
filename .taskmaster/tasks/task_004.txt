# Title: Implement Tag Assignment for Bounding Boxes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: After a bounding box is drawn, provide a mechanism for the user to assign a predefined tag (Button, Input, Radio, Dropdown) to it.
# Details:
A dropdown menu or a modal could appear after drawing a box. The list of drawn boxes and their tags should be displayed on the side for review.

# Test Strategy:
Draw a box, assign a tag from the list, and verify it's associated correctly. Test editing or deleting a box/tag. Ensure the state reflects all changes.
